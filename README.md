# luno-app
This repo gives a starting point for connecting to the LunoApi from a reactjs application.

## Setup
- Generate an api key and secret on your luno.com account. (https://www.luno.com/wallet/security/api_keys)
- Update server.js to your api key and secret. (Remember never to push these to a public repo). 

## Note
The example doesn't include a post request, if you'd like to make a post request remember to send it in the correct format
